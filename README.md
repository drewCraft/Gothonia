The game revolves around atoms, ever card has one atom on it. A card can either attack the other player, or defend attacks from the other player. you use your atoms increase your score and decrease the other players score before the game ends

<b><i>YOUR HAND:</i></b>
when you start the game. you start with a had of five cards. evry turn, you can play three basic cards, two uncomman cards, or one extreme card. You can also place different types of cards together; see the combos spredsheet for more info. at the start and end of each turn, you can take a card from you stack. Your stack is a group of five three cards that you <i>must</i> pick from when you draw a card. when you pick a card, that card will go into your hand. when your players turn ends any enpty spaces in the stack will be refilled. Evey turn you <i>don't</i> pick a card from the stack, it gains power (see below).
